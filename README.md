# DataWrangling_CandidateSearch

### Overview

An outsourcing compnay in Customer Service is looking for team leaders with the new campaign they are about to launch. In order to help out the HR department to speed up the recruiting process. I will be creating a resume parser to screen the candidates. This project will fasten the hiring process and assit recruiters to filter out unqualified candidates for the first round, the qualified candidates will move to the second process for further screening. I will be using 16 resumes, 1 csv file for a list of candidates and one file for job description. Resumes are collected on the internet such as Velvet Jobs with fictitious names. The content of job description is collected from Linkedin with a small modification.
